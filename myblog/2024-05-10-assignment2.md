### About the data

The dataset we used in this project is the San Francisco crime dataset, which is downloaded from the San Francisco official city data website. The range we selected is Police Department Incident Reports from 2003 to 2018. The crime report provides specific information such as crime type, time, area, etc. Among all these data, this webpage will focus on the development trends of two crime types: DRUG/NARCOTIC and DRUNKENNESS. We want to know how these two crime types have evolved over the years - The frequency of crime? Crime time? The distribution of crime areas? All these information will be illustrated in the pictures and descriptions below.

### 24-hour cycle of two crimes

The first question to think about is: If I want to travel within a day, when is the most likely time to encounter these two crimes? The 24-hour cycle chart can give us a good answer. The following are the figures.
